🚀 Java Learning Journal (Days 1–6)

🗓️ **Day 1 – Kicking Off with Git**
- 🔑 Figured out the difference between Git (tool) & GitHub (platform)
- 🌱 Learned about repos, branches, and merges
- ✍️ Practiced commit → push → pull workflow
- ⏳ Explored version history & commit messages
- ✅ **Takeaway:** I can now manage my code versions without fear of losing progress.

🗓️ **Day 2 – Inside the Java Machine**
- 🧠 Understood JVM architecture
- 📝 Learned what compiler vs interpreter actually do
- 🧹 Discovered how garbage collection keeps memory clean
- ✅ **Takeaway:** I finally see what’s happening when my Java code really runs.

🗓️ **Day 3 – Back to the Basics**
- 📦 Worked with variables, literals & data types
- 📥 Practiced basic I/O
- ➕ Explored operators
- 🪄 Tried `var` keyword for type inference
- 🌀 Got clarity on scope of variables
- ✅ **Takeaway:** Stronger grip on the building blocks of coding.

🗓️ **Day 4 – Logic & Flow**
- 🔄 Learned sequence, selection (`if/else`, `switch`), iteration (loops)
- 📋 Used for-each loop
- 🚦 Practiced transfer statements (`break`, `continue`, `return`)
- 🖩 Built a basic calculator app
- ✅ **Takeaway:** My programs can now “decide” and “repeat” like real problem solvers.

🗓️ **Day 5 – Diving into Arrays**
- 📚 Practiced 1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional arrays
- 🛠️ Used `java.util.Arrays` class utilities
- 📤 Tried array copying with `System.arraycopy()`
- ✅ **Takeaway:** Arrays = structured ways to hold multiple values neatly.

🗓️ **Day 6 – Strings & Methods Galore**
- 📝 **Strings:**
    - Used `String`, `StringBuilder`, `StringBuffer`, `StringTokenizer`
    - Practiced string methods (`length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, etc.)
    - Passed strings as parameters
    - Reviewed ASCII character codes
- ⚡ **Methods:**
    - Wrote own methods (user-defined)
    - Explored static & library methods
    - Played with `Math` class methods (`Math.random()`)
- ✅ **Takeaway:** Strings + methods made my code more reusable, dynamic, and powerful.

🌟 **Overall Progress (Days 1–6)**
- ✔ Version control with Git
- ✔ Understood Java internals (JVM & Garbage Collector)
- ✔ Covered basics → loops → arrays → strings → methods

🚀 **Next stop:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
